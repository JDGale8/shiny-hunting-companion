# Readme #

This is designed to be a companion for people who want to hunt shiny pokemon

## To be added ##

So far everything, this is not a finished project in any form at this time.
The main functionality is going to be as follows:

### Simulation ###
Depending on the method involved, the user can run a simulation of X number of trials.
For example:
If I am using the Masuda method *without* the shiny charm, and I hatch 500 eggs, do I get any shiny pokemon?
This is only really useful to give the user a genuine idea of what it's like to go on this journey, and what to expect.
If they want to sit down and try to hatch 500 eggs with the Masuda method, how likely is it going to work out for them.
Run the simulation a couple times and find out!

The following situations need to be simulated:
* Egg Hatching
* Random encounters
* Horde encounters
* Friend Safari
* Soft Resetting
     * Starter Soft Resetting


### Tracking ###
The user should be able to start inputting how many SR's they've made, and how many eggs they've lain.

The app should then be able to say what % a chance they should have found a shiny by now
Once they have found a shiny as well, the app should keep track of these by ungraying a sprite or putting together
a list of total found shinies.

Maybe I could make a verification process and a leaderboard. Who knows!

### IDEAS ###

Here I'm just going to write down ideas so they're somewhere
* Ability to change the favicon to your favourite pokemon
